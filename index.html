                <h2>Bread</h2>
                <p>Bread is an excellent source of complex carbohydrates that give our body the energy it needs and plays an important role in balancing the levels of glucose in the blood. Certain types of bread, like granary bread, have a high fibre content, which strengthens the operation of the digestive system.</p>

                <h2>Salad</h2>
                <p>Eating a salad a day is directly correlated with higher nutrient levels.
                    Adding salad dressing to a salad increases the absorption of certain nutrients being consumed.</p>

                <h2>Soup</h2>
                <p>Soup is a go-to food when temperatures plummet, and whether you're heading out or coming in from the
                    cold, a quick bowl of your favourite concoction should work wonders warming you up. If you're
                    feeling very chilly, opt for ingredients that help heat the body such as ginger, chilli and spices
                    like cinnamon or cloves, and serve your soup in a mug if your hands need extra warming.</p>
